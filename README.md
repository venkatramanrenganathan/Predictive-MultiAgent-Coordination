## Dependencies
- Matlab

## Steps to Run the Code 
1. Run the `main.m` file, it will automatically load all the necessary data and will run the simulation
2. In `main.m` file, the following changes can be made as per discretion.
   * Line 34 - Set total simulation time step
   * Line 35 - Set total number of agents
   * Line 45 - Change dataPrepFlag to 1 when running for first time building data and to 0 when analysing the data.
   * Line 90 - Choose simScenario to select the attack type
   * Lines 128-135 - Choose the attack duration as per your wish accordingly to simulate the selected attack
